# Content Ingestion Strategy

## Original Source
Path: `C:\Users\JaZeR\OneDrive\Desktop\Resource Websites\FL Studio Master Reference Hub`
Files: index.html, script.js, styles.css

## Ingestion Approach
Copy-minimal strategy was implemented, extracting content from the original HTML file and reorganizing into a Next.js application structure.

## Content Extraction
- Tutorial content extracted from HTML structure
- Workflow diagrams maintained in visual format
- Music production techniques organized into sections
- Feature comparison data extracted from tables

## Migration Notes
- Original JavaScript elements converted to React components
- Workflow diagrams recreated with appropriate visualization libraries
- Tutorial content organized into pages/sections structure
- FL Studio feature information converted to structured data
