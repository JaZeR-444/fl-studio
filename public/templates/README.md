# FL Studio Templates

This directory contains downloadable FL Studio project files (.flp) for each template in the database.

## File Naming Convention

Templates should be named using the following pattern:
```
{genre}-{name-slug}.flp
```

Examples:
- `edm-progressive-house.flp`
- `trap-808-banger.flp`
- `lofi-chill-beats.flp`

## How to Add Templates

1. Create your FL Studio project with the template configuration
2. Save it with the naming convention above
3. Place the .flp file in this directory
4. The website will automatically link to it for download

## Template Checklist

Each template should include:
- ✅ Pre-routed mixer tracks
- ✅ Appropriate BPM and key signature
- ✅ Starter patterns/loops
- ✅ Recommended plugin instances
- ✅ Color-coded channels
- ✅ Basic arrangement markers

## Current Templates

Place your .flp files here. The download system will serve them from:
`/templates/{filename}.flp`

## Placeholder System

If a template .flp file doesn't exist yet, the system will:
1. Show a download button
2. Provide template details as JSON
3. Give manual setup instructions
